# Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), the open-source smart-home hub, set up and run for you on your Wizard. You never have to open it yourself: you talk to your agent.

- **Connect your devices** once: pick your brand and sign in. It works with any brand Home Assistant supports.
- **Already run Home Assistant at home?** Choose "My own Home Assistant" and paste its address and an access token instead. Local-only devices like Zigbee and Bluetooth then work too.
- **Your agent** checks and controls your devices: "start the vacuum", "is the air bad at home?", "put the purifier on sleep".

Camera video stays in the brand's own app. Unlocking doors or disarming alarms always needs your yes.
